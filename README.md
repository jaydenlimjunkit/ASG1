# Gameshub
For this project i have decided to create a games review website. There will be a login page for users and a page where users can rate different top grossing games from 1 to 5 stars. 

### Design Process
As a gamer, i want to be able to view what a game has in store before buying it
As a gamer, i want to see if the game has a generally good reviews from the public
As a game critic, i want to help others to determine what types of games are worth it for a specific genre

### Features

#### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users to view what are the top games of the year
Feature 2 - allow users to view what are the game critic's opinion on the game
Feature 3 - allows the user to write their own review on the game
